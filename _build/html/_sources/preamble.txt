Preamble
********

Shortly after his arrest in 1986, a high-school junior published `“The Conscience of a Hacker” <http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=7&id=3&mode=txt>`_ under the pseudonym *The Mentor*. Known popularly as “The Hacker Manifesto,”  it says very little about the (ab)use of technology; instead, The Mentor offers chilling insights into secondary-school pedagogy from a student's perspective: “The Conscience of a Hacker” ultimately offers both a searing indictment of public education *and* a forgotten stub of a manifesto for substantive school reform.

When we listen, we recognize in him the caring `Mentor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentor>`_, as he shares wisdom from sage experience as a public school student and as a successful independent learner. [#]_

We understand that wisdom [#]_ as an unambiguous call to

* `differentiate instruction  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction>`_;
* provide rigorous content;
* maintain rigorous expectations;
* value authentic learning and assessment that serves beyond the walls of the classroom;
* encourage and provide for `connected learning  <http://dmlhub.net/sites/default/files/ConnectedLearning_report.pdf>`_.

We recognize that since 1986, pedagogy research has followed The Mentor in calling for these best-practice mandates. We bear witness to the chilling effects of the following power centers on the implementation and innovation of best practices for our students: The State; School Boards; Superintendents; The Principal and administration; The Federal Governamnet; Lobbyists.

We recognize too that the Mentor is not alone, and that schools have been failing students across the curriculum since the success of Sputnik. [#]_

We are authorities in our fields, `professional <http://books.google.com/books/about/Professionalism_and_Ethics_in_Teaching.html?id=Ny2eD-ZebUoC>`_ scholars and academics. We contribute to knowledge and bring discipline to the content areas. We end now the 26-years of silence the education community offered in response to The Mentor's substantive and expert testimony.

We will not be complicit in the violent neglect of school children. [#]_

Now is the Just-in-Time deposition of administrators and lawmakers who have perpetrated violence and perpetuated social and economic injustice by impeding our urgent transgression. [#]_

.. [#] To engage the mentor, we must come to terms. The titular *Hacker* invokes not the digital intruder...Ellipses to Coleman, code, political heritage, meritocracy
.. [#] "It's the truth, even if it didn't happen." (Kesey)
.. [#] Approximately 25 of every 100 students drop out before graduating; A 2010 report finds that only 24 percent of high schoolers who took the ACT were college-ready in all subject areas; in 2000, 28 percent of entering college freshmen enrolled in one or more remedial reading, writing, or mathemematics courses; as of 2008, only 55.9 percent of first-time, full-time bachelor's degree-seeking students earned a degree within six years (Wolk). Wolk makes clear that this is not an improvement over time (contrasted with 1981 data).
