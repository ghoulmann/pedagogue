The Conscience of the Pedagogue
*******************************

*We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.*

--The Mentor

We hear The Mentor clearly now in retrospect and register our understanding with this Just-in-Time Insurrection.

Education's Purpose
-------------------

As scholars, we share The Mentor's “transgressive” quest. We resolve, then, to collaborate with you to make the most of our mutual transgression, to transgress effectively, transgress creatively, and transgress efficiently in pursuit of knowledge.

We do not seek after knowledge because we are patriots committed to our nation's competitive edge in a global market. Nor do seek after knowledge in the interest of luxurious retirement. Policies and practices justified by those assumptions shall be transgressed and stricken.

Like you, like Einstein, we are committed to education because we are committed to individual independence.

Like you, like Godwin, we are committed to education because we are committed to individual happiness.

Expect, then, no fallacious appeals to nationalism or bribes of posh potential from us.

We recognize that your interest – our shared interest – is in the practice of liberation, not submission.

Rely on us to stand united and resolute against Those who seek to ensure not your education, but rather your docile submission.

We share in a mission: we shall develop, together, the core literacy to articulate our unfreedom.

We shall not allow your school to remain an advertising agency for the status quo, nor a factory for the manufacture of consent.

This marks the end of our tenure as commodities circulating on the marketplace: our schools will not be markets, our services will not be commodities. We will not be labor left alienated our sacred mission and your best interest.

We shall not navigate a marketplace in the interests of spectral stakeholders. Anticipate this: we will tactically resist and bluntly depose those who call for us to merchantalize your time or commodify your place in your space. They shall not speculate on our pursuit of knowledge.

*Organizational headings are temporary*

Schools shall be a Practicuum in Freedom, Emancipation, Liberation
==================================================================

We recognize that your interest, our mutual interest, lies in practicing liberation, not submission.

"The only rational way of educating is to be an example -- if one can't help it, a warning example." (Einstein 61)

"the aim must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals, who, however, see in the service of the communityy their highest life problem" (Einstein 65)

You will have the core literacy to articulate our unfreedom. [zize]

School shall not be a marketplace
=================================

Your school shall not be an ad agent for the status quo nor a factory for the manufacture of consent. [Illich][Chomsky]


Schools shall not be part-time prisons
======================================

We will raze hierarchies
========================

We consult each others' authority, not defer to Theirs. We answer to calls for papers, not for human resources, hall monitors, or proctors.

Schools as Markets
==================

We shall not sell products, circulate on the market, or provide services: We shall not navigate a marketplace in the interests of spectral stakeholders. Anticipate this: we will tactically resist and bluntly depose those who call for us to merchantalize your time or commodify your place in your space.

Part-Time Prisons and Manufactured Consent
==========================================

We shall not be puppets on the set of a part-time prison - We shall not play guards of students feigning docile subjection - outside or inside our subject area. We shall not participate in the frivolous abuse of premium time for substantive scholarship and achievement. Rely on us to stand united and resolute against Those who seek to ensure not your education, but rather your docile subjectivity [submission].

Practicing Freedom
===================

We recognize that your interest, our mutual interest, lies in practicing liberation, not submission.

Content and Rigor
=================

We yearn to share and grow and contribute in content areas where we are competent – but and even more so, we yearn to nourish others. Some professionals catch your drift and silently stew about malnourished students eager for substantive satisfaction. But those who were passive will act now with us or else brood in an environment that can tolerate their post-cynical comas.

And we will act decisively, strategically, and tactically to ensure that competent leadership, serving by our mutual consensus, commits every resource to an academic rigor that serves each of you beyond the tenuous, temporary, and tentative schoolhouse walls.

Conduct and Content
===================

Justly strike, with us, inequitable and arbitrary institutional behavior guidelines that are not supported by curricula – strike them with surgical precision or catastrophic and monolithic erasure or purge of institutional memory at our shared discretion.


Suspension Justice
==================

Moreover, enforcement of policies - just and unjust - will never interfere with the inalienable right to an appropriate education recognized by court precedent. The only zero-tolerance rhetoric will come collectively from our united voices calling out and calling down those who would stand to call you banned from your place at the table at their whim.

Looking for Criminals
=====================

In support of these resolutions, we declare no confidence in an institutional culture where every action may be recalled as an infraction and will redefine it collaboratively at our discretion.

Self-Rule
=========

We remember now the high stakes of the international struggles of students in 1968, and will never again take for granted your right to transparency and an equitable role in institutional governance.

Differentiated Instruction
==========================

You are not all alike. We shall uphold your inalienable privilege not to be conflated with other students or bound by lazy minds who recognize, determine, or discipline with all the brutish consequences of dim-witted hasty generalizations or vulgar prejudices.

We advocate for and win every students' inalienable privilege to access the curriculum as best suits them, and will displace Those who, through incompetence or malicious misappropriation, fail to deliver to you the resources your instruction calls for. We therefore commit to partnerships in your unique, rigorous pursuits and will depose malefactors who conflate you with your colleagues; b-school and ed-school graduates who justify this mistake in the lonely, despotic logic of the stakeholder will resign out of necessity, out of shame, or out of ruin.

Standardized Tests
==================

With this declaration, High-stakes tests that hold no instructional value – that bear the counterfeit faces of equity and social justice and economic justice – no longer can count on us for their security, integrity, validity. We are not to be trusted to proctor, or participate any longer in perpetually erecting the impossible gatekeeping mechanisms intended to bar your access.

Collaboration, Freedom, Connection
==================================

No, we do not identify with colleagues who cite a disembodied “calling” to teach. We do feel compelled, however, to answer an insistent call to practice and model collaboration, freedom, and connected scholarship: scholarship connected to your interests, to your communities, to your peers, and to your ambitions. This fiercely urgent call comes in contrast, from the meat-embodied voices of the marginalized, subjected, vulnerable, nondominant.  

Heterarchies, Stration
======================

We recognize the need for administrators, perhaps leadership, but we value heterarchies and anarchies over hierarchies. We have the experience, resources, expertise, and research to depose and refactor insidious hierarchies - throughout the community - from your striated lunch room to Their closed boardroom.

The impulse to vulgarly stratify and rank our peers, your colleagues, is an obstacle to our goals we share in spite of our discrete Difference.

We thus call now for a leadership eager to pioneer heterarchical and distributed responsibility. When we're all administrators, our responsibilities fluidly defined by our relationships of praxis, we can look forward to the extirpation of the institutional stratification that, on one hand, inhibits connected learning through peer-to-peer collaboration and consultation among students, and on the other produces leadership that perpetuates a culture of competition over a culture of collaboration among faculty.

Clearly, we are not all alike and you are not all alike. Ours is not a monolithic threat. But it's no less real or potent. Our common stakes, interests, and values call for nothing less than coordinated, collaborative reform.
