	This is a problemâ€”for young people and for our country. We need STEM-related talent to compete globally, and we will need even more in the future. It is not a matter of choice: For the United States to remain the global innovation leader, we must make the most of all of the potential STEM talent this country has to offer. (USNews, John Engler, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/06/15/stem-education-is-the-key-to-the-uss-economic-future)

	Everything changes with the emancipation of the slave and the internalization of the master by the emancipated slave. Hegemony begins here in the disappearance of the dual, personal, agonistic domination for the sake of integral reality--the reality of networks, of the virtual and total excahange where there are no longer dominators or dominated....this brings us back to the literal meaning of the word "cybernetic". (Baudrillard, *The Agony of Power* 33-34)

	The only rational way of educating is to be an example -- if one can't help it, a warning example. (Einstein 61)

	the aim must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals, who, however, see in the service of the community their highest life problem. (Einstein 65)
